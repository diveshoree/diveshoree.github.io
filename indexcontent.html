  <H3>Week 1</H3>
	<p> On week 1, we discussed on our project along side with our team members. We decided to work on the Part Cribs Database.
		So basically, in this week our task was to toggle the LED lights </p>

	<H4> Problem Encountered </H4>
	<p> I was facing some technical issues with my webcam, so I has to order an another one on Amazon.ca. Delivery date is expected on 10/14/2016.
	Please note, my budget got exceeded due to the webcam purchase. I will have to spend 22$ because the previous webcam was mine.</p>

	<H3> Week 10 Progress Report </H3>

<p>In week 10, my group (Rafil,Masoud and Gurpreet) and I, we demonstrated to the whole class the functionality of our project, the Humber parts crib. The whole program was run on python platform. We were successful in demonstrating how we can use the camera to scan any barcode and display it on the monitor. How it works? So basically, we get a barcode, we scan it using the camera, the number on the barcode is saved in a text file then if we use the ‘cat’ command, we should be able to see the scanned barcode. Every time, a barcode is scanned, that text file is updated with the new barcode.
		</p>
		<p>
Problems encountered:

We noticed that scanning the barcode took us some time due to the quality of our cameras. Therefore, we decided to make a stand to make the scanning process more effective and quick rather than trying to find the appropriate spot to get it scanned. 

In case if our budget allows us, we might get a barcode laser scanner to scan our barcodes or as we discussed in class with our Professor Kristian Medri, we might talk to the School of Applied Technology, if they can help us to accommodate this effective tool to make this project better.

	<H3> Week 11 Progress Report </H3>
	
		<p> After demonstrating the functionality of our hardware project, in this week 11 we will go on to build our case for our hardware. We also demonstrated our hardware project (scanning the barcode of different barcode strips) to our teacher Mr. Kristian Medri. As we decided to make a camera stand for our cameras because last week, we were facing some issues in order to scan the barcode strip properly. We will start working towards that by strpping on the designing phrase then if everything is good then we will move to the building phrase. Our other option was we might go to the Applied Technology and see if they can help us with a laser scanner in order to make this project more effective and less time consumming. </p>
