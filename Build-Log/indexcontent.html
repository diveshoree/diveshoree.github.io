	 <p><b>i) Introduction</b></p>
	 <p>This project is a collaboration of the Humber Parts Crib which will allows students to sign off items for 
	 their labs on regular basis. In short, the main purpose of this whole project is to make the Humber Part Cribs more effective to deal with a large number of students.
	 So basically, I will have a camera which I will use in order to scan the barcode strip on the student card and that barcode will get input electronically in the system. 
	 I will be using the LED on the PCB to show if the barcode was scanned successfully. 
	 Once it is scanned, that barcode information is sent on a txt file where the user can see and have access to it.

	<p> Please find the system diagram of our project as follows below:
		<img src=systemdiagram.PNG alt="systemdiagram" style="width:700px;height:400px;">
	<p>This diagram will show the input on how a barcode a scanned through a camera, how the raspberry pi 3 is connected to a server and process the information 
	and finally how the android application fetches the data from the database and display it in real life.

	<H3>Time Commitment</H3>
	 <p><b>Overall week-by-week time commitment schedule:</b>
	 <p>In this section, it is basically an explanation on how much time it took me from ordering the components and to have a working product as I expected. 
	 According to my gantt chart (please check on my github), it took me approximately 14 weeks in order to finish everything. 
	 I ordered my Raspberry Pi 3 from Amazon.ca. The shipping was around 1 week (Arrived on week 4). Once I got it, it took me around 1 hour to setup and 
	 try to understand how the raspberry pi functions. Moving from there, on week 4, I got PCB soldered, tested and it was ready to go.
	 The soldering took me approximately 2 and a half hour to finish everything. On week 6, I implemented the traffic2B program in order 
         to test the LEDs which I was planning on using as a recognition whether the barcode are scanned successfully or not. 
	 On week 7, unfortunately I started to face some issues with my camera and I was obliged to get an another. The shipping time was 
         pretty quick, I got the camera within 4 business days from Amazon.ca. In week 8 and 9, I started working on Python on how 
	 to make the webcam recognize the barcodes. In week 10, implementation and testing phrase, the camera was working absolutely fine, the 
	 camera was recognizing the barcodes and transferring the information in a text file on the terminal. In week 11, I decided to use
	 the LEDs of the PCB in order to make the project more effective; Toggle a green light if scanning is successful and then red if unsuccesful.
	 Then I decided to get a VGA cable which I could use in the computer labs. In week 12 and 13, I got my acrylic box done, the box design took me about 2 hours
	 to complete and the lazar cut took about 15-30 minutes.

	<H3>Mechanical Assembly</H3>
	<p>The mechanical assembly for this project is actually very simple. All you have to do is get your raspberry pi 3 connected on the monitor.</p>
	Steps: <br>
	<li>Plug your power supply which is connected to your raspberry pi, </li> <br>
	<li>Use a VGA to HDMI to your monitor,</li> <br>
	<li>Connect your keyboard and mouse to your raspberry pi,</li> <br>
	<li>Don't forget to configure your monitor to VGA settings,</li><br>
	<li>Boot up,</li><br>
	<li>After that, connect your camera,</li><br>
	<li>Go to the appropriate file directory and run the program using the appropriate commandline,</li><br>
	<li>Hold your barcode in a fixed and steady position,</li><br>
	<li>Watch the LEDs light, once it turns green. You're good to go,</li><br>
	<li>Use the command "cat" to concatenate the .txt file and see your information.</li><br>
	
	<p>This is basically the mechanical assembly and the overall steps that a user needs to remember in order to be 
	able to use this hardware equipment.</p>

	<H3>PCB/Soldering</H3>
	 <p>First, I would like to share my PCB soldering task which I completed in week 4. Please find a picture below:</p>
	 <img src=PCB_SOLDER.jpg alt="PCB Solder" style="width:700px;height:400px;">
	 
	 <p>The PCB consists of a 20 pin GPIO header, two 4 pin header, 5 pin header, resistors, transistors, LED and some jumpers.</p>
	 
	 <p>The PCB is also known as the Modular Sensor Hat. I got it from Humber College. The soldering was pretty simple as the schematic was given to us showing where the components are supposed to go. 
	 The only challenging thing for me was the soldering because it was my first time. However everything went good and the soldering
	 was successful. While soldering, I had to make sure that I am wearing my safety glasses for my safety and avoid from having any sort of
	 liquid (water, coffee etc..) around me which might be harmful.</p>
 
</SECTION>
	
 <SECTION ID="Section_5">
	<H3>Power Up</H3>
	<p> After the mechanical assembly is completed, you can now power up your raspberry pi. Make sure everything is connected. 
	 Update your raspberry pi to the latest version if you haven't done so. Use the command "sudo apt-get update. You can either 
	 run the traffic2B program by running the command "sudo./traffic2B" or you can run the barcode scanner program by using the command
	 "python programname.py", this will start the window for your camera and your should be able to scan the barcodes.</p>
	
	 <p><b>Please check a power up video for the traffic2B program below:</b></p>
