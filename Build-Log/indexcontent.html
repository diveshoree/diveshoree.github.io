	 <p><b>i) Introduction</b></p>
	 <p>This project is a collaboration of the Humber Parts Crib which will allows students to sign off items for 
	 their labs on regular basis. In short, the main purpose of this whole project is to make the Humber Part Cribs more effective to deal with a large number of students.
	 So basically, I will have a camera which I will use in order to scan the barcode strip on the student card and that barcode will get input electronically in the system. 
	 I will be using the LED on the PCB to show if the barcode was scanned successfully. 
	 Once it is scanned, that barcode information is sent on a txt file where the user can see and have access to it.

	<p><b>ii) System Diagram</b></p>
	<p> Please find the system diagram of our project as follows below:
		<img src=systemdiagram.PNG alt="systemdiagram" style="width:700px;height:400px;">
	<p>This diagram will show the input on how a barcode a scanned through a camera, how the raspberry pi 3 is connected to a server and process the information 
	and finally how the android application fetches the data from the database and display it in real life.
