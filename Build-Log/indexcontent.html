	 <p><b>i) Introduction</b></p>
	 <p>This project is a collaboration of the Humber Parts Crib which will allows students to sign off items for 
	 their labs on regular basis. In short, the main purpose of this whole project is to make the Humber Part Cribs more effective to deal with a large number of students.
	 So basically, I will have a camera which I will use in order to scan the barcode strip on the student card and that barcode will get input electronically in the system. 
	 I will be using the LED on the PCB to show if the barcode was scanned successfully. 
	 Once it is scanned, that barcode information is sent on a txt file where the user can see and have access to it.
